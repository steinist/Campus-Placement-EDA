Therefore, given that students graduate from an identical university, we would like to dive deeper into the inward factors that behave as strong predictors regarding job placement. We hope the findings will be valuable for universities, to adequately prepare its students for the job market, and for students, to best prepare themselves for the job-searching massacre amidst the rapidly deprecating economy due to the mischievous COVID-19.
